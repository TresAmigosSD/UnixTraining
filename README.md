# Unix Training For Data Scientists

This is a quick introduction to the most useful unix commands for folks doing data manipulation in a unix environment.  It is not a comprehensive introduction to Unix operating system (not even when constrained to topic at hand).

For details explanation of the commands described in the following chapters, users should utilize the "man" command to show the manual page for a given command.  For example:
```bash
$ man grep
```
The above will show a detail manual page for the grep command.
